## Project Description
This project recreates the front page of the Urdu newspaper "Dawat" (The Invitation) published before 1990. The original newspaper featured a prominent headline about India's ongoing food crisis, with articles discussing price increases, profiteering, and government efforts to address these challenges. The HTML recreation maintains the newspaper's column-based layout structure while translating and rephrasing the original Urdu content into English. The layout uses semantic HTML5 tags and table-based structures to replicate the traditional newspaper column format.

## Features Implemented
- **Semantic HTML5 Structure**: Used `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` tags for proper document structure
- **Table-based Layout**: Implemented multi-column newspaper layout using HTML tables to match the original design
- **Heading Hierarchy**: Proper use of `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<h4>` tags for content organization
- **Image Integration**: Placeholders for newspaper logo, article photos, and masthead images with proper alt attributes
- **List Elements**: Included an unordered list (`<ul>`) to present key challenges in a structured format
- **Inline Styling**: Used inline styles for formatting, colors, alignment, and borders (no external CSS files)
- **HTML Comments**: Comprehensive comments explaining each major section of the code
- **Proper Indentation**: Consistent 4-space indentation throughout the document

## Challenges Faced
The main challenge was recreating the traditional newspaper column layout using only HTML and inline styles, without external CSS. This was solved by using HTML tables to create the multi-column structure, which closely mimics the original newspaper's layout. Another challenge was translating and rephrasing the Urdu content while maintaining the original meaning and context, ensuring the content is unique and properly formatted for the HTML structure.
